Derive the URL dynamically using window.location.origin + '/admin'. Render it in a styled read-only input or code block with monospace font and distinct background consistent with the dark gaming theme. Add a 'Copy' button that uses navigator.clipboard.writeText() to copy the URL and shows 'Copied!' feedback for 2 seconds using local state (useState with setTimeout). Label the section clearly as 'Admin URL'. Ensure the element appears only in the authenticated state, below the existing add-player form."
