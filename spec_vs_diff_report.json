  "summary": "The diff implements most requirements well. REQ-22 (backend no-op redeployment) is addressed with a comment added to main.mo. REQ-23 through REQ-28 are largely implemented with polished UI components. However, REQ-26's delete player functionality is explicitly removed (noted in file summaries: 'delete functionality removed since the backend has no deletePlayer method'), meaning the player list rows cannot show a delete button as required. All other requirements appear substantially addressed.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "Player list rows in AdminModal must show a delete button; the modal must include delete player functionality per the AC 'Player list rows are readable with name, tier, category, score, and delete button'",
      "reason": "The file summary for AdminModal.tsx explicitly states 'delete functionality removed since the backend has no deletePlayer method.' The AC for REQ-26 requires a delete button in each player list row, but this has been removed.",

      "reason": "The build request does not mention creating a new /admin page, an AdminUrlCard component, or a URL copy feature. The spec only requires polishing the existing AdminModal component.",
