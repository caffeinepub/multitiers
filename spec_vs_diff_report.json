  "summary": "The diff implements all requirements from REQ-19 in AdminPage.tsx. The AdminUrlCard component displays the full /admin URL derived from window.location.origin + '/admin', uses a monospace read-only display, includes a Copy button using the Clipboard API, shows 'Copied!' feedback for 2 seconds, is styled consistently with the dark gaming theme, and is only visible after authentication. All constraints are respected: hooks are untouched, no Admin link added to Navbar, and changes are confined to AdminPage.tsx.",
